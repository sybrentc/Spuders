          # By default, this action pushes to the 'gh-pages' branch.
          # If you wanted to push to a different branch, you could specify:
          # publish_branch: gh-pages
          # If your repository is a private repository and you want to deploy to a public site,
          # you might need to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of GITHUB_TOKEN
          # and configure it as a secret. For public repos, GITHUB_TOKEN usually suffices.
